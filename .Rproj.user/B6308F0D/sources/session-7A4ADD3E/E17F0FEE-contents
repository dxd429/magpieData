Description: The package 'magpieData'
 is designed to provide sample MeRIP-seq data for the package 'magpie' in examples and
 vignette generation.
 These .BAM files contain chromosome 15 data of the dataset (GSE46705)
 from a study investigating METTL3-METTL14 complexmediates mammalian nuclear RNA 
 N6-adenosine methylation. In this dataset, there are two sample types 
 from human HeLa cell line: one wild type (WT) sample and one treated sample. The 
 treatment corresponds to the knockdown (KD) of complex METTL3. Each sample contains two replicates.
